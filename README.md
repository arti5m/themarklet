# themarklet

A few tools that work together to allow you to test your CSS and JS on a site without having to upload or push code. Anyone on the same network can use your bookmarklet to test your code (from your machine) in their browser.

## Installation
```bash
npm run build
```

*Note: Chrome will disallow the bookmarklet from using its magic for pages served over https. The simplest way around that is to click the shield icon in the address bar to allow mixed content.*
